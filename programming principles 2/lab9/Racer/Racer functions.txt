Sure, let's go through all the functions in the code:

1. pygame.init():
   - This function initializes the Pygame library and its subsystems.
   - It must be called before using any other Pygame functions.

2. pygame.time.Clock():
   - This function creates a new clock object.
   - The clock object is used to control the frame rate of the game.

3. pygame.font.SysFont(name, size):
   - This function creates a new font object from the system fonts.
   - The name parameter specifies the font name, and the size parameter specifies the font size in pixels.

4. font.render(text, antialias, color):
   - This method renders the given text onto a new surface using the current font.
   - The antialias parameter determines whether anti-aliasing (smoothing of edges) should be applied or not.
   - The color parameter specifies the color of the text.

5. pygame.image.load(file_path):
   - This function loads an image from the specified file_path.
   - It returns a new surface object with the image data.

6. surface.get_rect():
   - This method returns a new rectangle object that perfectly encloses the surface.
   - The rectangle object has attributes like left, right, top, bottom, center, etc., which can be used to position the surface on the screen.

7. pygame.key.get_pressed():
   - This function returns a list of boolean values representing the state of each key on the keyboard.
   - If a key is pressed, its corresponding boolean value in the list is True, otherwise False.

8. rect.move_ip(x, y):
   - This method moves the rectangle object by the given x and y offsets, in-place.
   - The _ip suffix stands for "in-place", meaning that the original rectangle is modified.

9. pygame.sprite.spritecollideany(sprite, group):
   - This function checks if the given sprite collides with any sprite in the group.
   - If a collision is detected, it returns the first sprite from the group that collides with the given sprite.
   - Otherwise, it returns None.

10. pygame.mixer.Sound(file_path).play():
    - This function loads a sound from the specified file_path and plays it.

11. time.sleep(seconds):
    - This function suspends the execution of the current thread for the specified number of seconds.

12. surface.fill(color):
    - This method fills the entire surface with the specified color.

13. surface.blit(source, dest):
    - This method draws the source surface onto the current surface at the dest position.
    - The source can be another surface, a rectangle, or an object with a rect attribute.
    - The dest is a tuple or rectangle specifying the position on the current surface.

14. pygame.display.update():
    - This function updates the entire display surface with the changes made since the last update.

15. clock.tick(fps):
    - This method delays the game loop to ensure that the game runs at the desired fps (frames per second).
    - It returns the number of milliseconds since the last call to tick().

16. pygame.time.set_timer(event_type, milliseconds):
    - This function schedules a new event of the specified event_type to be generated every milliseconds.
    - The event_type should be a unique constant, typically created using pygame.USEREVENT + n.

17. sprite.kill():
    - This method removes the sprite from all sprite groups it belongs to.

18. pygame.quit():
    - This function uninitializes all Pygame modules and quits the Pygame library.

19. sys.exit():
    - This function exits the Python interpreter immediately.

Sure, let's go through each function/method used in this part of the code:

1. pygame.display.update():
   - This function updates the entire display surface with the changes made since the last update.
   - It takes the contents of the video memory and transfers them to the display screen.
   - It should be called after all the drawing operations are completed for a frame.

2. DISPLAYSURF.blit(background, (0, 0)):
   - This line uses the blit method to draw the background image onto the DISPLAYSURF surface at the coordinates (0, 0), which is the top-left corner.
   - The blit method stands for "blit" or "block transfer," which means transferring a portion of one surface onto another.

3. for entity in all_sprites::
   - This is a loop that iterates over each sprite in the all_sprites group.

4. entity.move():
   - This line calls the move method of each sprite (entity) in the all_sprites group.
   - The move method is responsible for updating the position of the sprite based on its movement logic.

5. DISPLAYSURF.blit(entity.image, entity.rect):
   - This line uses the blit method to draw the image of each sprite (entity) onto the DISPLAYSURF surface at the position specified by the sprite's rect (rectangle).

6. pygame.sprite.spritecollideany(P1, enemies):
   - This function checks if the P1 sprite (the player) collides with any sprite in the enemies group.
   - If a collision is detected, it returns the first sprite from the enemies group that collides with P1.

7. pygame.mixer.Sound("C:\\Users\\Darya\\Documents\\programming-principles-2\\lab8\\Racer\\crash.wav").play():
   - This line loads the sound file located at the specified path and plays it.
   - It is executed when a collision between the player and an enemy is detected.

8. time.sleep(1):
   - This line pauses the execution of the program for 1 second.
   - It is called after playing the crash sound to create a brief pause.

9. DISPLAYSURF.fill(RED):
   - This line fills the entire DISPLAYSURF surface with the RED color.
   - It is executed after the pause, presumably to display a red background for the "Game over" message.

10. DISPLAYSURF.blit(game_over, (30, 250)):
    - This line draws the game_over text surface onto the DISPLAYSURF surface at the coordinates (30, 250).

11. pygame.display.update():
    - This line updates the display surface with the changes made (i.e., the red background and the "Game over" text).

12. for entity in all_sprites: entity.kill():
    - This loop iterates over each sprite in the all_sprites group and calls the kill method on each sprite.
    - The kill method removes the sprite from all sprite groups it belongs to, effectively removing it from the game.

13. time.sleep(2):
    - This line pauses the execution of the program for 2 seconds after the "Game over" message is displayed.

14. pygame.quit():
    - This function uninitializes all Pygame modules and quits the Pygame library.

15. sys.exit():
    - This function exits the Python interpreter immediately, terminating the program.

16. increase_speed(E1, C1):
    - This line calls the increase_speed function, passing the E1 (Enemy instance) and C1 (Coin instance) as arguments.
    - The purpose of this function is to update the enemy speed and display it on the screen.

17. pygame.display.update():
    - This line updates the display surface again, reflecting any changes made by the increase_speed function.

18. FramePerSec.tick(FPS):
    - This line calls the tick method of the FramePerSec clock object.
    - The tick method delays the game loop to maintain the desired FPS (frames per second) rate.
    - It ensures that the game runs at a consistent frame rate, preventing it from running too fast or too slow.

This part of the code handles the game loop, drawing sprites, checking for collisions between the player and enemies, displaying the "Game over" message and exiting the game when a collision occurs, updating the enemy speed, and regulating the frame rate.
