#1. Loop through a list

#Example 1. Print all items in the list, one by one:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in thislist:
    print(x)

#2. Loop through the index numbers
#Example1. Print all items by referring to their index number:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
    print(thislist[i])
print("\n")

#3. Using a While loop

#Example 1. Print all items, using a while loop to go through all the index numbers
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(thislist):
    print(thislist[i])
    i = i + 1

#4. Looping Using List Comprehension
#Example 1. A short hand for loop that will print all items in a list:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[print(x) for x in thislist]
