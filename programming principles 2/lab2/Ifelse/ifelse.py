#1. If statement:
"""
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
    print("b is reater than a")

#2. Elif example:

a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")

#3. Else example:

a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")
else:
    print("a is greater than b")

#4. Else without elif example:

a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
else:
    print("b is not greater than a")

#5. One line if statement (Short hand if):

a = 200
b = 33

if a > b: print("a is greater than b")

#6. Oe line if else statement

a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")

#7. One line if else statement, with 3 conditions:

a = 330
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

#8. Test if a is greater than b, AND if c is greater than a:

a = 200
b = 33
c = 500
if a > b and c > a:
    print("Both conditions are True")

#9. Test if a is greater than b, OR if a is greater than c:

a = 200
b = 33
c = 500

if a > b or a > c:
    print("At least one of the conditions is True")

#10. Test if a is NOT greater than b:

a = 33
b = 200

if not a > b:
    print("a is NOT greater than b")

#11. Nested if example:

x = 41

if x > 10:
    print("Above ten,")
    if x > 20:
        print("and also above 20!")
    else:
        print("but not above 20.")

#12. The pass statement example:

a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
    pass

# having an empty if statement like this, would raise an error without the pass statement
