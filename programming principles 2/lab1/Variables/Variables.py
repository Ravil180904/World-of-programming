#1. Creating variables
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)


x = 4
x = "Sally"
print(x)


#2. Casting
x = str(3) # x will be '3'
y = int(3) # y will be 3
z = float(3) # z will be 3.0


#3.Get the type

x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))


#4. Single or double quotes

x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'


#5. Case-sensitive
a = 4
A = "Sally"
print(A, a)
#A will not overwrite a
