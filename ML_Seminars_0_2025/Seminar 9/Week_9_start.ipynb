    "# Logistic Regression for Identifying Depression Among Students\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview\n",
    "In this task, you will use Logistic Regression to predict whether a student is experiencing depression based on different factors such as academic pressure, sleep habits, and financial stress. You will go through the full machine learning process, from exploring the data to training and evaluating a model. You are also encouraged to create visualizations to better understand the data and support your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "We will use the Student Depression Dataset (good timing after mid term exam I guess).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features:\n",
    "- **Gender**: Male/Female\n",
    "- **Age**: Student’s age\n",
    "- **City**: City where the student lives\n",
    "- **Academic Pressure**: Level of academic stress\n",
    "- **Work Pressure**: Level of work-related stress\n",
    "- **CGPA**: Student’s academic performance\n",
    "- **Study Satisfaction**: How satisfied the student is with their studies\n",
    "- **Job Satisfaction**: Satisfaction with a job (if applicable)\n",
    "- **Sleep Duration**: Sleep hours category (e.g., \"Less than 5 hours\", \"5-6 hours\")\n",
    "- **Dietary Habits**: Eating habits (e.g., Healthy, Moderate)\n",
    "- **Degree**: The degree the student is pursuing\n",
    "- **Suicidal Thoughts**: Whether the student has had suicidal thoughts (Yes/No)\n",
    "- **Work/Study Hours**: Hours spent working or studying daily\n",
    "- **Financial Stress**: Level of financial pressure\n",
    "- **Family History of Mental Illness**: Whether the student has a family history of mental illness (Yes/No)\n",
    "- **Depression**: (Target variable: 1 = Has depression, 0 = No depression)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "### **Use the df DataFrame from the cell below for all tasks.**\n",
    "### Task 1 – Explore the Data\n",
    "    Understand the dataset and find interesting patterns :\n",
    "        - Use basic pandas functions to check the data.\n",
    "        - Look for missing values, outliers, and patterns in the features.\n",
    "        - Create visualizations such as heatmap, histograms, bar charts, scatter plots etc. to explore relationships between different features and depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2 – Data Preprocessing\n",
    "    Clean and prepare the data for modeling : \n",
    "        - Handle missing values (e.g., filling or removing them). \n",
    "        - Convert categorical variables into numbers using encoding. \n",
    "        - Normalize or standardize numerical features if needed.\n",
    "        - Explain why you made certain preprocessing choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3 – Train the Model\n",
    "    Train a Logistic Regression model to predict depression : \n",
    "        - Split the data into training and testing sets.\n",
    "        - Train a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn. Look at the different parameters in scikit learn libraries ant try to change some of them (only if you can understand them).\n",
    "        - Make predictions on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 4 – Evaluate the Model\n",
    "    Measure how well the model performs : \n",
    "        - Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "        - Create a confusion matrix to see how often the model makes correct and incorrect predictions.\n",
    "        - Plot an ROC curve to analyze model performance.\n",
    "        - Think on how we could analyse predicted probabilities\n",
