First code:
# Visualize relationships between features and depression
categorical = ['Gender', 'Sleep Duration', 'Dietary Habits', 'Degree', 'Have you ever had suicidal thoughts ?', 'Family History of Mental Illness']
numerical = ['Age', 'Academic Pressure', 'Work Pressure', 'CGPA', 'Study Satisfaction', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Work/Study Hours', 'Financial Stress']

# Categorical features vs Depression
for col in categorical:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
    sns.countplot(x=col, hue='Depression', data=df)
    plt.title(f'{col} vs Depression')
    plt.show()

# Numerical features vs Depression
for col in numerical:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
    sns.histplot(data=df, x=col, hue='Depression', kde=True, bins=30)
    plt.title(f'{col} distribution by Depression')
    plt.show()

# Heatmap of correlations (after encoding categorical for visualization)
df_viz = df.copy()
for col in categorical:
    df_viz[col] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df_viz[col].astype(str))
plt.figure(figsize=(14,8))
sns.heatmap(df_viz.corr(), annot=True, fmt='.2f', cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Feature Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()

Let's break down and **explain each part of your code** for visualizing the relationships between features and depression in your dataset.

---

## 1. **Variable Definition**

```python
categorical = ['Gender', 'Sleep Duration', 'Dietary Habits', 'Degree', 
               'Have you ever had suicidal thoughts ?', 'Family History of Mental Illness']
numerical = ['Age', 'Academic Pressure', 'Work Pressure', 'CGPA', 
             'Study Satisfaction', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Work/Study Hours', 'Financial Stress']
```

- `categorical`: This is a list of column names in your dataframe (`df`) that represent **categorical variables** (i.e., variables with a limited number of distinct values/categories, often text such as "Male"/"Female", "Yes"/"No", or types of sleep duration).
- `numerical`: This is a list of **numerical variables** (variables that are continuous or discrete numbers).

---

## 2. **Categorical Features vs Depression**

```python
for col in categorical:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
    sns.countplot(x=col, hue='Depression', data=df)
    plt.title(f'{col} vs Depression')
    plt.show()
```

- **Loop through each categorical feature.**
- For each:
  - Create a new figure of size 6x3 inches.
  - Use `sns.countplot()` to plot the count of each category (x-axis) **split by the 'Depression' value** (shown as different colors/bar segments due to the `hue='Depression'` argument).
  - This helps you **see how the distribution of categories varies between depressed and non-depressed students**.
  - Add a title and display the plot.

**Example Insight:**  
You might see that students with "Unhealthy" dietary habits have a higher count of depression cases (the colored bar for 1 is larger in that category).

---

## 3. **Numerical Features vs Depression**

```python
for col in numerical:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
    sns.histplot(data=df, x=col, hue='Depression', kde=True, bins=30)
    plt.title(f'{col} distribution by Depression')
    plt.show()
```

- **Loop through each numerical feature.**
- For each:
  - Create a new figure.
  - Use `sns.histplot()` to plot a histogram of the feature, with different colors for each value of 'Depression'.
  - `kde=True` adds a smoothed "curve" over the histogram to visualize the probability density.
  - This lets you **compare the distributions of each feature for depressed vs non-depressed students**.
  - Add a title and show the plot.

**Example Insight:**  
You might observe that students with lower CGPA have a higher density of depression cases.

---

## 4. **Heatmap of Correlations**

```python
df_viz = df.copy()
for col in categorical:
    df_viz[col] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df_viz[col].astype(str))
plt.figure(figsize=(14,8))
sns.heatmap(df_viz.corr(), annot=True, fmt='.2f', cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Feature Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

- **Make a copy of your dataframe** so you don't affect the original.
- **Encode categorical columns as numbers** (required for calculating correlations).
  - `LabelEncoder` assigns a unique number to each category, so your categorical data becomes numeric.
- **Calculate the correlation matrix** with `df_viz.corr()` which gives the Pearson correlation coefficient between all pairs of features (including the target 'Depression').
- **Plot a heatmap** of this correlation matrix:
  - Each cell shows the correlation between a pair of features.
  - `annot=True` shows the correlation value in each cell.
  - `cmap='coolwarm'` colors the cells from blue (negative correlation) to red (positive correlation).
- **This visualization helps you quickly spot which features are most strongly correlated with depression or with each other.**

**Example Insight:**  
A correlation close to +1 or -1 between a feature and 'Depression' means that feature is very predictive of depression.

---

## **Summary**

- **Countplots**: Show how categorical values relate to depression.
- **Histograms**: Show how the distribution of each numerical feature differs between depressed and non-depressed students.
- **Correlation heatmap**: Shows how strongly each variable is related to every other, including the target.

**These visualizations are essential for:**
- Understanding your data.
- Spotting trends, outliers, and relationships.
- Guiding feature selection and engineering for your machine learning model.

Second code:
# Fix column names to match CSV exactly for binary encoding
BINARY_LABELS = {
    'Gender': {'Female': 0, 'Male': 1},
    'Have you ever had suicidal thoughts ?': {'No': 0, 'Yes': 1},
    'Family History of Mental Illness': {'No': 0, 'Yes': 1},
}
for col, mapping in BINARY_LABELS.items():
    df[col] = df[col].map(mapping)

# Label encode other categoricals
cat_cols = ['Sleep Duration', 'Dietary Habits', 'Degree']
for col in cat_cols:
    df[col] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df[col].astype(str))

# Fill missing values if any
for col in df.columns:
    if df[col].isnull().sum() > 0:
        if df[col].dtype in ['float64', 'int64']:
            df[col].fillna(df[col].median(), inplace=True)
        else:
            df[col].fillna(df[col].mode()[0], inplace=True)

# Drop non-model columns
X = df.drop(['id', 'City', 'Profession', 'Depression'], axis=1)
y = df['Depression']

# Standardize numeric columns
num_cols = ['Age', 'Academic Pressure', 'Work Pressure', 'CGPA', 'Study Satisfaction', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Work/Study Hours', 'Financial Stress']
scaler = StandardScaler()
X[num_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(X[num_cols])

# Show processed features
X.head()

Here’s a line-by-line explanation of your preprocessing code:

---

### 1. **Binary Encoding for True/False Columns**

```python
BINARY_LABELS = {
    'Gender': {'Female': 0, 'Male': 1},
    'Have you ever had suicidal thoughts ?': {'No': 0, 'Yes': 1},
    'Family History of Mental Illness': {'No': 0, 'Yes': 1},
}
for col, mapping in BINARY_LABELS.items():
    df[col] = df[col].map(mapping)
```
- **Purpose:** Converts categorical columns with two possible values ("binary") into 0 and 1 (numerical). This is necessary for most machine learning models.
- **How:** For each specified column, “Female” becomes 0, “Male” becomes 1, “No” becomes 0, “Yes” becomes 1, etc.

---

### 2. **Label Encoding for Multi-Class Categoricals**

```python
cat_cols = ['Sleep Duration', 'Dietary Habits', 'Degree']
for col in cat_cols:
    df[col] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df[col].astype(str))
```
- **Purpose:** Converts columns with more than two categories (e.g., 'Sleep Duration' might be "5-6 hours", "7-8 hours", etc.) into integer codes: 0, 1, 2, ...
- **How:** Uses `LabelEncoder` to assign a unique integer to each category in each column.

---

### 3. **Fill Missing Values**

```python
for col in df.columns:
    if df[col].isnull().sum() > 0:
        if df[col].dtype in ['float64', 'int64']:
            df[col].fillna(df[col].median(), inplace=True)
        else:
            df[col].fillna(df[col].mode()[0], inplace=True)
```
- **Purpose:** Ensures the dataframe has no missing values, which most ML models require.
- **How:** For numeric columns, missing values are replaced with the column’s median. For non-numeric (categorical) columns, missing values are replaced with the most frequent value (the mode).

---

### 4. **Prepare Features and Target**

```python
X = df.drop(['id', 'City', 'Profession', 'Depression'], axis=1)
y = df['Depression']
```
- **Purpose:** Splits your data into:
    - `X`: All columns you want to use as input features for the model (removes irrelevant columns and the target itself).
    - `y`: The target variable (whether the student has depression).

---

### 5. **Standardize Numerical Columns**

```python
num_cols = ['Age', 'Academic Pressure', 'Work Pressure', 'CGPA', 'Study Satisfaction', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Work/Study Hours', 'Financial Stress']
scaler = StandardScaler()
X[num_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(X[num_cols])
```
- **Purpose:** Normalizes all numeric features to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This is important for models (like logistic regression) that are sensitive to the scale of features.
- **How:** Uses `StandardScaler` to transform each column.

---

### 6. **Show the Processed Features**

```python
X.head()
```
- **Purpose:** Displays the top 5 rows of the processed features for inspection.

---

## **Summary**

- Converts all relevant columns to numeric values (binary or label-encoded).
- Fills any missing values.
- Removes irrelevant columns.
- Standardizes all numeric features.
- Prepares the data for machine learning modeling.

**This block of code is a robust preprocessing pipeline for tabular ML tasks.**

Third code:
# Train/test split (always stratify on imbalanced target)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=42)

# Train Logistic Regression
lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, random_state=42)
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)
y_pred_prob = lr.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]

Here’s what this code does, **step-by-step and with explanation**:

---

## 1. **Train/Test Split – with Stratification**

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state=42
)
```

- **Purpose:**  
  Split your data into training and testing sets.  
  - `test_size=0.2`: 20% of the data goes into the test set, 80% into the train set.
  - `stratify=y`: Ensures the **proportion of classes** (depressed/not depressed) is the same in both sets. This is important if your target variable is imbalanced.
  - `random_state=42`: Sets a seed for reproducibility, so you get the same split every time you run the code.

---

## 2. **Instantiate and Train Logistic Regression**

```python
lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, random_state=42)
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

- **Purpose:**  
  - `LogisticRegression`: Creates a logistic regression model from scikit-learn.
  - `max_iter=1000`: Allows up to 1000 iterations for model convergence (prevents warnings for convergence on larger datasets).
  - `random_state=42`: Ensures results are reproducible.
  - `.fit(X_train, y_train)`: Fits (trains) the model on your training data.

---

## 3. **Make Predictions**

```python
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)
y_pred_prob = lr.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
```

- `y_pred`: **Predicted class labels** (0 or 1) for each student in your test set.
- `y_pred_prob`: **Predicted probabilities** for class 1 (i.e., probability the student is depressed).  
  - `predict_proba` returns a 2D array of probabilities for [class 0, class 1].  
  - `[:, 1]` selects the probability for class 1 (depressed).

---

### **Summary**

- **Splits** the data into train/test, preserving class balance.
- **Trains** a logistic regression model on the training data.
- **Predicts** both the class and the probability of depression for each student in the test set.

---

**Why is this good?**
- Stratification ensures fair evaluation especially with imbalanced classes.
- Probabilities (`y_pred_prob`) let you analyze model performance at different thresholds (e.g., for ROC curve, or setting a custom decision cutoff).
- This is the standard supervised ML workflow for binary classification!

Fourth code:
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
prec = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
rec = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print("Confusion Matrix [TN FP; FN TP]:\n", cm)
print(f"Accuracy: {acc:.3f} | Precision: {prec:.3f} | Recall: {rec:.3f} | F1: {f1:.3f}")
print('\nClassification report:')
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

Here’s what your code does, step by step, with explanation for each metric and output:

---

### 1. **Calculate Evaluation Metrics**

```python
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
prec = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
rec = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
```

- **accuracy_score:**  
  The proportion of all correct predictions (both classes) among all predictions.
  \[
  Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
  \]

- **precision_score:**  
  Out of all predicted positives, how many were actually positive?
  \[
  Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
  \]

- **recall_score:**  
  Out of all actual positives, how many did the model correctly identify?
  \[
  Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
  \]

- **f1_score:**  
  The harmonic mean of precision and recall (better when classes are imbalanced).
  \[
  F1 = 2 \times \frac{Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall}
  \]

- **confusion_matrix:**  
  Shows the counts of:
  ```
  [[TN, FP],
   [FN, TP]]
  ```
  Where:
  - TN: True Negatives
  - FP: False Positives
  - FN: False Negatives
  - TP: True Positives

---

### 2. **Print Results**

```python
print("Confusion Matrix [TN FP; FN TP]:\n", cm)
print(f"Accuracy: {acc:.3f} | Precision: {prec:.3f} | Recall: {rec:.3f} | F1: {f1:.3f}")
print('\nClassification report:')
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

- **Confusion Matrix:**  
  Prints the counts for each combination of predicted/actual class, so you can see where your model is getting things right or wrong.

- **Metrics:**  
  Prints the calculated Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score rounded to three decimals.

- **Classification Report:**  
  Gives a table showing precision, recall, and f1-score for each class (0: not depressed, 1: depressed), as well as overall averages. This is helpful for quickly seeing how your model performs on each class, especially if the classes are imbalanced.

---

### **Summary**

This block is the **standard way to summarize classification model performance in scikit-learn**.  
It helps you:
- Assess overall and per-class performance.
- Understand trade-offs (e.g., is recall high but precision low?).
- See the confusion matrix for insight into types of errors (false positives/negatives).

**Interpretation:**  
- If you care about “catching all depressed students,” focus on recall.
- If you want “few false alarms,” focus on precision.
- F1 is a good single number to balance both, especially for imbalanced classes.

Fifth code:
thresholds_plot = np.linspace(0, 1, 101)
TPs, TNs, FPs, FNs = [], [], [], []
precisions, recalls, f1s, accs = [], [], [], []
for thresh in thresholds_plot:
    y_thresh = (y_pred_prob >= thresh).astype(int)
    tn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_thresh).ravel()
    TPs.append(tp)
    TNs.append(tn)
    FPs.append(fp)
    FNs.append(fn)
    precisions.append(tp/(tp+fp) if (tp+fp)>0 else 0)
    recalls.append(tp/(tp+fn) if (tp+fn)>0 else 0)
    f1s.append(f1_score(y_test, y_thresh))
    accs.append(accuracy_score(y_test, y_thresh))

# Plot TP, TN, FP, FN vs threshold
plt.figure(figsize=(7,5))
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, TPs, label='TP')
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, TNs, label='TN')
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, FPs, label='FP')
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, FNs, label='FN')
plt.xlabel('Threshold')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('TP, TN, FP, FN by Threshold')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Plot evaluation metrics vs threshold
plt.figure(figsize=(7,5))
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, precisions, label='Precision')
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, recalls, label='Recall')
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, f1s, label='F1-score')
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, accs, label='Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Threshold')
plt.ylabel('Metric Value')
plt.title('Evaluation Metrics by Threshold')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

Let's break down and **explain your code** step by step. This code helps you analyze how different prediction thresholds affect your classification results and metrics in a binary classification problem (like predicting depression).

---

## 1. **Set Up Thresholds**

```python
thresholds_plot = np.linspace(0, 1, 101)
```
- Creates 101 evenly spaced thresholds between 0 and 1 (inclusive), e.g., 0.00, 0.01, ..., 1.00.
- Each threshold will be used as a cutoff for converting predicted probabilities to binary class predictions.

---

## 2. **Initialize Lists**

```python
TPs, TNs, FPs, FNs = [], [], [], []
precisions, recalls, f1s, accs = [], [], [], []
```
- Empty lists to store the counts of True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), False Negatives (FN), and values for precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy at each threshold.

---

## 3. **Loop Over Thresholds**

```python
for thresh in thresholds_plot:
    y_thresh = (y_pred_prob >= thresh).astype(int)
    tn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_thresh).ravel()
    TPs.append(tp)
    TNs.append(tn)
    FPs.append(fp)
    FNs.append(fn)
    precisions.append(tp/(tp+fp) if (tp+fp)>0 else 0)
    recalls.append(tp/(tp+fn) if (tp+fn)>0 else 0)
    f1s.append(f1_score(y_test, y_thresh))
    accs.append(accuracy_score(y_test, y_thresh))
```
- For each threshold:
  - **Convert probabilities to binary predictions:**  
    - If the predicted probability is greater than or equal to `thresh`, predict 1 (depressed); otherwise, 0 (not depressed).
  - **Compute confusion matrix:**  
    - Gives counts of TN, FP, FN, TP for this threshold.
  - **Store the counts.**
  - **Compute and store metrics:**  
    - Precision = TP/(TP+FP)  
    - Recall = TP/(TP+FN)  
    - F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall)  
    - Accuracy = (TP+TN)/total

---

## 4. **Plot TP, TN, FP, FN vs Threshold**

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(7,5))
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, TPs, label='TP')
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, TNs, label='TN')
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, FPs, label='FP')
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, FNs, label='FN')
plt.xlabel('Threshold')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('TP, TN, FP, FN by Threshold')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
- Shows how the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives change as you move the threshold from 0 to 1.
- **Interpretation:**  
  - At low thresholds, almost everything is predicted positive (high TP, high FP, low TN, low FN).
  - At high thresholds, almost everything is predicted negative (high TN, high FN, low TP, low FP).

---

## 5. **Plot Metrics vs Threshold**

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(7,5))
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, precisions, label='Precision')
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, recalls, label='Recall')
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, f1s, label='F1-score')
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, accs, label='Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Threshold')
plt.ylabel('Metric Value')
plt.title('Evaluation Metrics by Threshold')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
- Shows how precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy change as you sweep the threshold.
- **Interpretation:**
  - **Precision** usually increases as the threshold increases (fewer false positives), but recall drops (more false negatives).
  - **Recall** is highest when the threshold is low (almost everything is predicted positive), then decreases.
  - **F1-score** balances precision and recall; often peaks at an intermediate threshold.
  - **Accuracy** may peak where the model balances correct positive and negative predictions.

---

## **Why do this?**

- The default threshold for binary classification is 0.5, but **the best threshold depends on your application**.
- These plots help you choose a threshold that best meets your goals (e.g., high recall if you want to catch as many depressed students as possible, or high precision if you want fewer false alarms).

---

## **Summary**

- **This code shows how the confusion matrix components and metrics change as you change the decision threshold.**
- **It helps you visualize and select the best threshold for your specific needs.**
- **This is a critical step in any real-world binary classification problem, especially with imbalanced data.**

Sixth code:
# Cost calculation: assume cost_per_positive (hospital) and cost_per_false_negative (missed case)
cost_per_positive = 1000  # cost for sending a student to hospital (TP or FP)
cost_per_fn = 5000        # cost for missing a depressed student

costs = []
for tp, fp, fn in zip(TPs, FPs, FNs):
    cost = (tp+fp)*cost_per_positive + fn*cost_per_fn
    costs.append(cost)

# Plot cost vs threshold
plt.figure(figsize=(7,5))
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, costs, label='Total Cost')
plt.xlabel('Threshold')
plt.ylabel('Cost')
plt.title('Total Financial Cost vs Threshold')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Find optimal threshold
min_cost_idx = np.argmin(costs)
optimal_threshold = thresholds_plot[min_cost_idx]
print(f'Optimal threshold (min total cost): {optimal_threshold:.2f} with cost {costs[min_cost_idx]:.2f}')

Here's a **line-by-line explanation** of your code for threshold selection based on financial cost:

---

## 1. **Define Costs**

```python
cost_per_positive = 1000  # cost for sending a student to hospital (TP or FP)
cost_per_fn = 5000        # cost for missing a depressed student
```
- `cost_per_positive`: The cost you pay *every* time you classify someone as "depressed" (whether truly depressed or not). This covers **all positives**: both true positives (TP) and false positives (FP).
- `cost_per_fn`: The cost you pay *every* time you miss a truly depressed student (false negative, FN).  
  This is typically much higher, as missing a real case can be serious.

---

## 2. **Calculate Total Cost at Each Threshold**

```python
costs = []
for tp, fp, fn in zip(TPs, FPs, FNs):
    cost = (tp+fp)*cost_per_positive + fn*cost_per_fn
    costs.append(cost)
```
- For each threshold (you have previously computed TPs, FPs, FNs for all thresholds):
    - **(tp + fp) \* cost_per_positive**: The total cost for all students sent to hospital (all predicted positives, both correct and incorrect).
    - **fn \* cost_per_fn**: The total cost for all real depression cases that were missed by the model.
    - The sum is the **total cost** for that threshold.
- Store each total cost in the `costs` list.

---

## 3. **Plot Cost vs Threshold**

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(7,5))
plt.plot(thresholds_plot, costs, label='Total Cost')
plt.xlabel('Threshold')
plt.ylabel('Cost')
plt.title('Total Financial Cost vs Threshold')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
- Plots the **total cost** as you change the threshold.
- This shows you visually which threshold minimizes your overall cost.

---

## 4. **Find the Optimal Threshold**

```python
min_cost_idx = np.argmin(costs)
optimal_threshold = thresholds_plot[min_cost_idx]
print(f'Optimal threshold (min total cost): {optimal_threshold:.2f} with cost {costs[min_cost_idx]:.2f}')
```
- **Finds the index** of the minimum value in the `costs` list.
- The **optimal threshold** is the threshold value at that index.
- Prints out the optimal threshold and the corresponding minimum total cost.

---

## **Summary**

- This code **finds the decision threshold that minimizes the total financial cost** for your specific business/clinical scenario.
- **Why is this important?**  
  Standard metrics like accuracy or F1-score may not align with real-world costs.  
  By incorporating financial (or health) costs, you can make a better, context-aware decision for your model's operating point.

---

**In practice:**  
- You can adjust `cost_per_positive` and `cost_per_fn` to reflect your real-world priorities, and the code will automatically identify the most cost-effective threshold.
- This is a crucial step in deploying ML models in domains like healthcare, fraud, etc., where the consequences of errors are not equal!

Seventh code:
# Refit best model on train for interpretability
best_lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, random_state=42, **gs.best_params_)
best_lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_best = best_lr.predict(X_test)
y_pred_prob_best = best_lr.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]

# Analyze TP, TN, FP, FN populations
df_test = X_test.copy()
df_test['True'] = y_test.values
df_test['Pred'] = y_pred_best
df_test['PredProb'] = y_pred_prob_best
df_test['Group'] = 'Other'
df_test.loc[(df_test['True']==1)&(df_test['Pred']==1), 'Group'] = 'TP'
df_test.loc[(df_test['True']==0)&(df_test['Pred']==0), 'Group'] = 'TN'
df_test.loc[(df_test['True']==0)&(df_test['Pred']==1), 'Group'] = 'FP'
df_test.loc[(df_test['True']==1)&(df_test['Pred']==0), 'Group'] = 'FN'

# Compare feature means by group

Here's what your code does, step-by-step, with explanations and tips:

---

## 1. **Refit the Best Logistic Regression Model**

```python
best_lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, random_state=42, **gs.best_params_)
best_lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_best = best_lr.predict(X_test)
y_pred_prob_best = best_lr.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]
```
- You refit a new model using the **best hyperparameters** found by GridSearchCV (`gs.best_params_`).
- Predict the class (`y_pred_best`) and predicted probability (`y_pred_prob_best`) for the test set.

---

## 2. **Analyze TP, TN, FP, FN Populations**

```python
df_test = X_test.copy()
df_test['True'] = y_test.values
df_test['Pred'] = y_pred_best
df_test['PredProb'] = y_pred_prob_best
df_test['Group'] = 'Other'
df_test.loc[(df_test['True']==1)&(df_test['Pred']==1), 'Group'] = 'TP'
df_test.loc[(df_test['True']==0)&(df_test['Pred']==0), 'Group'] = 'TN'
df_test.loc[(df_test['True']==0)&(df_test['Pred']==1), 'Group'] = 'FP'
df_test.loc[(df_test['True']==1)&(df_test['Pred']==0), 'Group'] = 'FN'
```
- You create a new DataFrame `df_test` with the test set features and add:
  - The true label (`True`)
  - The predicted label (`Pred`)
  - The predicted probability (`PredProb`)
  - The group label (`Group`), which is one of: TP (True Positive), TN (True Negative), FP (False Positive), FN (False Negative).
- This lets you **easily compare characteristics of samples the model gets right or wrong**.

---

## 3. **Compare Feature Means by Group**

```python
group_means = df_test.groupby('Group')[numerical+cat_cols+BINARY_LABELS.keys()].mean(numeric_only=True)
display(group_means)
```
- You compute the **mean value of each feature** for each group (TP, TN, FP, FN).
- This helps you see which features are higher/lower for each outcome; for example, maybe FN have lower CGPA than TP, etc.
- `display()` is for Jupyter; use `print(group_means)` if in a .py file.

---

## 4. **Boxplots of Feature Distributions by Group**

```python
for feat in ['Academic Pressure', 'CGPA', 'Sleep Duration']:
    plt.figure(figsize=(7,4))
    sns.boxplot(x='Group', y=feat, data=df_test)
    plt.title(f'{feat} by TP/TN/FP/FN')
    plt.show()
```
- For each chosen feature, this makes a boxplot showing the distribution within each group (TP, TN, FP, FN).
- **Interpretation:**  
  - Wide separation between groups suggests the feature is informative.
  - For example, if FNs have lower CGPA than TPs, the model may be missing depressed students with low grades.

---

## 5. **Logistic Regression Weights (Feature Importances)**

```python
feature_importance = pd.Series(best_lr.coef_[0], index=X.columns).sort_values(ascending=False)
plt.figure(figsize=(8,7))
feature_importance.plot(kind='barh')
plt.title('Feature Importance (Logistic Regression Weights)')
plt.show()
display(feature_importance)
```
- Logistic Regression is linear, so each feature has a weight (coefficient).  
  - **Positive coefficients** increase the log-odds of predicting "depressed".
  - **Negative coefficients** decrease it.
- Sorting and plotting shows the most influential features.
- `display(feature_importance)` shows the ordered list (Jupyter); use `print(feature_importance)` elsewhere.

---

## **Summary**

- You refit and interpret your model, not just by global metrics but by **group-level analysis** (TP, TN, FP, FN).
- You examine **feature distributions** and **model coefficients** to understand why the model makes its predictions and where it might go wrong.
- This is essential for **model explainability** and for identifying possible improvements (e.g., more features, fixing bias).

Fixed task 1 in part a:

categorical = ['Gender', 'Sleep Duration', 'Dietary Habits', 'Degree', 'Have you ever had suicidal thoughts ?', 'Family History of Mental Illness']
numerical = ['Age', 'Academic Pressure', 'Work Pressure', 'CGPA', 'Study Satisfaction', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Work/Study Hours', 'Financial Stress']

# Categorical features vs Depression
for col in categorical:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
    sns.countplot(x=col, hue='Depression', data=df)
    plt.title(f'{col} vs Depression')
    plt.show()

# Numerical features vs Depression
for col in numerical:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
    sns.histplot(data=df, x=col, hue='Depression', kde=True, bins=30)
    plt.title(f'{col} distribution by Depression')
    plt.show()

# Heatmap of correlations (after encoding categorical for visualization)
df_viz = df.copy()
for col in categorical:
    df_viz[col] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df_viz[col].astype(str))

# Only keep numeric columns for correlation
df_viz_numeric = df_viz.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

plt.figure(figsize=(14,8))
sns.heatmap(df_viz_numeric.corr(), annot=True, fmt='.2f', cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Feature Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()

Let's break down the code **step by step** and explain what each block is doing:

---

### 1. **Define Feature Lists**

```python
categorical = [
    'Gender', 'Sleep Duration', 'Dietary Habits', 'Degree',
    'Have you ever had suicidal thoughts ?', 'Family History of Mental Illness'
]
numerical = [
    'Age', 'Academic Pressure', 'Work Pressure', 'CGPA',
    'Study Satisfaction', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Work/Study Hours', 'Financial Stress'
]
```
- `categorical`: List of column names in your DataFrame (`df`) that have **categorical** data (like categories, groups, or yes/no answers).
- `numerical`: List of columns with **numerical** data (numbers and continuous values).

---

### 2. **Visualize Categorical Features vs Depression**

```python
for col in categorical:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
    sns.countplot(x=col, hue='Depression', data=df)
    plt.title(f'{col} vs Depression')
    plt.show()
```
- **Loop through each categorical feature.**
    - `plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))`: Set the size of the plot.
    - `sns.countplot(x=col, hue='Depression', data=df)`: Create a bar plot showing the count of each category in `col`, split by the values in the `Depression` column.
        - This visualizes how the distribution of each category differs between people with and without depression.
    - `plt.title(...)`: Add a title.
    - `plt.show()`: Display the plot.

---

### 3. **Visualize Numerical Features vs Depression**

```python
for col in numerical:
    plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))
    sns.histplot(data=df, x=col, hue='Depression', kde=True, bins=30)
    plt.title(f'{col} distribution by Depression')
    plt.show()
```
- **Loop through each numerical feature.**
    - `plt.figure(figsize=(6,3))`: Set plot size.
    - `sns.histplot(...)`: Create a histogram for column `col`, with different colors for each `Depression` group.
        - `kde=True`: Add a smooth density curve.
        - `bins=30`: Number of bins in the histogram.
    - `plt.title(...)`: Add a suitable title.
    - `plt.show()`: Show the plot.
- **Purpose:** To compare the distribution of numeric features between the depression groups.

---

### 4. **Prepare Data for Correlation Heatmap**

```python
df_viz = df.copy()
for col in categorical:
    df_viz[col] = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df_viz[col].astype(str))
```
- **Copy the original DataFrame** (`df_viz = df.copy()`).
- **Convert categorical columns to numeric codes** using `LabelEncoder` (since correlation requires numeric values).
    - For each categorical column, replace its values with integer codes.

---

### 5. **Select Only Numeric Columns**

```python
df_viz_numeric = df_viz.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
```
- **Keep only columns with numeric data types** in `df_viz_numeric` (after encoding categoricals).

---

### 6. **Plot the Correlation Heatmap**

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14,8))
sns.heatmap(df_viz_numeric.corr(), annot=True, fmt='.2f', cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Feature Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```
- `plt.figure(figsize=(14,8))`: Set plot size.
- `sns.heatmap(...)`: Plot a heatmap of the correlation matrix (shows how strongly pairs of features are related).
    - `annot=True`: Show correlation values in the heatmap.
    - `fmt='.2f'`: Format correlation values to 2 decimal places.
    - `cmap='coolwarm'`: Use a color scheme for positive/negative correlation.
- `plt.title(...)`: Add a suitable title.
- `plt.show()`: Show the plot.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step | What It Does | Why |
|------|--------------|-----|
| 1    | Define feature lists | Organize columns by type for analysis |
| 2    | Plot counts of categorical features vs depression | See categorical feature distribution split by depression status |
| 3    | Plot distributions of numerical features vs depression | See if depression groups differ in numeric features |
| 4    | Encode categoricals numerically | Prepare for correlation analysis |
| 5    | Select only numeric columns | Correlation only works with numbers |
| 6    | Plot correlation heatmap | Visualize all feature relationships |
