# Relational Databases

# Data is stored in tables (also called relations)
# Tables consist of rows and columns

# In general, each table represents 1 entity type (e.g. student)
# Columns represent attributes of that entity
# Rows are instances of that entity (also called tuples or records)

# In such database, we can:
# Create data
# Read data
# Update data
# Delete data
# Or usually refered to as CRUD

# RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
# We will PostgeSQL (also known as Postgres) as our RDBMS 

# SQL - Structured Query Language
# It is the language used to work with RDBMS

# To start, we need:
# - Download and install PostreSQL
#   - During installation you can leave everything on default
#   - Remember/Write down the password that you set during the installation
# - Install psycopg2 package
#   - pip install psycopg2 (or pip3)
#   - or
#   - pip install psycopg2-binary (or pip3)

import psycopg2

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host = 'localhost',
    dbname = 'suppliers',
    user = 'postgres',
    password = 'Ravil180904'
)

# Create a cursor to work with our DB
cur = conn.cursor()

# Querying the database
cur.execute('SELECT Version()')

db_ver = cur.fetchall() # Getting all data receiving by the query
print(db_ver)
