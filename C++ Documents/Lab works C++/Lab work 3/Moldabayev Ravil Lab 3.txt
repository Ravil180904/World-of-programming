Have you ever tried to create your own language? Akerke, another hero of our legends, 
states that it is very simple! She just picks up one letter of the Latin alphabet and never uses 
that letter anymore. That is the way how she comes up with a new language. 
Now, when her language has become very popular among her friends, she decided to make 
a translator. As she is not a programmer, she dared to ask for your help in this. The 
translator should get a string, delete all occurrences of some letter and output the modified 
string. 
Can you help Akerke in creating a translator?
